# AWIP Conversation Handoff System

## Overview
This system solves the critical problem of conversation continuity in AWIP by providing a reliable mechanism for Agent 20 to pass context between conversation instances, eliminating the 10-12k daily credit burn caused by infinite loops.

## System Components

### 📁 database/
- `handoff_schema.sql` - Database schema for storing conversation state and system status

### 📁 javascript/  
- `handoff_manager.js` - Core handoff management system with Supabase integration
- `agent_20_handoff.js` - Specialized interface for Agent 20 to report status and generate handoffs

### 📁 interface/
- `conversation_bridge.html` - User-friendly interface for accessing handoff prompts

### 📁 documentation/
- `deployment_guide.md` - Complete setup and usage instructions

## Quick Start

1. **Database Setup**: Run `database/handoff_schema.sql` in your Supabase project
2. **Deploy Files**: Copy JavaScript files to your project structure  
3. **Access Interface**: Use `conversation_bridge.html` to get handoff prompts
4. **Agent Integration**: Connect Agent 20 using `agent_20_handoff.js`

## Problem Solved

**Before**: Agent 20 creates handoffs → Files in AI Drive → New conversations can't access → Start blind → Repeat mistakes → 10-12k credit burn

**After**: Agent 20 updates database → Access bridge interface → Copy handoff prompt → Start new conversation with context → No more loops

## Expected Results

✅ Stop 10-12k daily credit burn  
✅ Eliminate infinite conversation loops  
✅ Provide conversation continuity  
✅ Enable Agent 20 visibility  
✅ Reliable context handoffs
